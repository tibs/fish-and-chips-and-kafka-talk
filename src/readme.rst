================================================
Demo for "Fish and Chips and Apache KafkaÂ®" talk
================================================

I use poetry_ to manage the dependencies needed by this demo.

Thus::

  poetry shell

to start a new virtual environment, and then::

  poetry install

to set it up with the necessary dependencies.
